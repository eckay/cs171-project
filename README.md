# About the Project
This project was created for Harvard's COMPSCI 1710 (Visualization) Final Project. We developed an interactive analysis of trends in banned books in the US across a variety of metrics such as location, reason for banning, genre, author, etc. We look forward to having you experience our project and see what we have learned from this class!

## Tooling
Our project was built using JavaScript and the D3 JS library. We utilized the [FullPage.js plugin](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) (imported via html) for our site's scrolling feature.
